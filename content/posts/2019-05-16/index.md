Found another way to give my money away.  Same way I went out in the last tournament. I guess I didn't
learn my lesson.
Lets start with the end.

**My last hand**: Middle position.  UTG+1 all in with a small stack.  I didn't have too much more.  I called
with `AJo`.  No idea why I did that.  Button called also.  Both players had `AKo`.  Ace on the river to account
for all the damn aces.

Other notable hands:

### **AA** UTG
Called.  I almost always do this.  No one raised.  So I got stuck with 6 players.  How often can I
win this?  I don't think often.  `KTx` rainbow.  I bet 600.  Almost everyone believes except for the button.
I check the turn which is a blank.  Button checks.  River brings a 9.  Completes a straight. I check. Button bets
1200.  I call.  I win. Next time I'll raise :)

### **AKh** middle position
Raised to 3BB.  1 caller.  2 hearts on the flop and a K.  This is good. I'm betting and hoping for a call.
I bet .75pot. Called.  Get the nut flush on the turn.  Bet again .25pot.  Called again.  River completes a straight.
I bet small...trying to make it look like a blocking bet.  He calls.  He has the straight.

### **AA** middle position
Raised to 3BB.  Same caller as above hand. He goes all in with 2500 chips or so.  Easy call.  He has `QQ`.
He gets the `Q` on the flop and gets another `Q` on the river.

### Next Hand **KQd** UTG
Raised to 3BB.  Button and big blind call.  All low cards on the flop.  Checked to me.  I bet
big 3500.  Button folds.  BB takes some time.  Chats with me.  Believes I have KK.  He eventually folds.  I show.  I liked the way I played this hand. I was aggressive.

### Other hands
I got `JJ` once and played `32s` (slightly on tilt).  Folded `A9o` a few hands before the `AJ` fiasco which I was thinking to jam and I would have gotten called by `77`, in which I would have won.

### Summary
I thought I played all right.  Didn't get too much luck (but got decent starting hands), but all it takes is one mistake.  And that was the last hand.  I can't call an allin with `AJo`.  Maybe not even `AJs`.  Especially with a few players behind.
I'm still learning.
