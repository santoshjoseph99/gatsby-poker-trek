This was a really good session.  I flopped sets. Won with aces.  I called an $105 bet when I had a flush draw
plus an inside straight vs 2 opponents (I think the decision was good)...result wasn't.

So I was up like probably $250.  I think I bought in for $300.  Thats my new thing, buy in more.  Lets move up
a little bit.  And this was right after I had won $250 in blackjack.  So I was in a good mood and with a couple
loose players on the table, it made for a fun session, till I got `76o` in the late position.  I think I was in
the hijack position.  Anyways, I called and so did 2 other players.  Flop comes out `768` rainbow.  So my 2 pair
really isn't a great hand here.  Either someone can flop a straight pretty easily or on a easy draw.  The opponent
before me bets $15. I call and so does the button.  Both of these players are lose and calling stations.  I've seen
the the initial flop bettor suffer with a decision before calling and didn't have a great hand at all.  Player on the
button called my 4-bet with aces and folded after my flop bet.  Mistake #1.  I didn't put either player on a range after
the flop (impossible to do preflop since we just called).  Turn bring a `7`, giving me a full house.  First player checks.
I bet $25 to build a post. I'm hoping someone(s) on a straight draw.  Both players call. River is a `J`.  No flushes,
but straight gets there.  Player before me bets $80.  I still haven't put either player on a range and I don't even know
how much is in the pot (mistakes #2, and #3).  I take my time and bet $200.  Button instantly raises $300 (he wanted to go allin), but we are playing spread limit ($3-$300). Initial bettor call with some reluctance.  So here is my biggest mistake.
I just snap all.  I should have spent some time analyzing.  What do my opponents have?  Also what do I have?  Yes, I have
a full house, but its like the 4th best hand.  `JJ`, `88`, `87` all beat me.  And I'm up against multiple opponents who
are calling and betting bigger amounts.  I should have have tanked and folded in my opinion.  Even though I'm like getting
3 to 1 on my money and I'm against loose players, but anytime against multiple players you really have to have the goods.
I lost.  Opponent one had `87` and button had `JJ` for the nuts.

Its a tough lesson.  Not sure if I should have raised.  But I definitely didn't get the verbal and physical tells my opponents gave to me.  I need to take my time and figure out the situation. I think playing on a more regular would help
me but also slowing down my game would also help.

I also just couldn't let go of the $200 I committed to the pot.  Its hard to give up that money, but I have to if I want
to make it to the next level.

I usually call when I have the best hand and I win 50%+ of my showdowns (I feel, but I don't have real numbers to back that up).  That hand wasn't so good at the end.  Even if that jack doesn't come I still lose to the initial bettor.

It turned out to be my biggest loss of any hand I have ever played.  Of course I wouldn't have minded if `I was getting the best of it`.

I busted out of the game a few hands later.  I had about $50 which I had doubled but then lost with `QQ` when just calling a bet instead of going all in.  Of course vs the player who had the `JJ`.  He was running good.
