Playing back in Kirkland.  Not so busy, but enough demand for a new table. 8 players join.  Little do they know, but they would get a few of my bucks.  My attitude is a little different at this session.  I play loose.  Not sure why.  There is a couple hands that I care to review.  I did get some decent cards but I couldn't shake people off the flop.

After a few folds, I straddle to 10 (first time doing that).
Got `j9o`.  3 players call in all. sb and cutoff.
Flop `j76`. Bet 25. Cutoff called.
Checked the turn for pot control. Folded to $50. Turn 5.
My only read vs this player is that he was a little aggressive and I guessing he had a `J` too but with a better kicker.

`JJ` in SB. Called a raise of $18 from button. 4 players
Q65. Checked. Initial raiser bets 100.
I folded.  He was a tight player and I felt he had an over pair.

I was playing loose, so why did I fold this hand?
Folded `46h` to $17 bet on the button.
Straight flush draw on flop which would have ended up with a straight flush (7 high) on T.  I could have tripled up.

`K9` on the bb. Checked.  Flop is `963`. Folded to $20 from CO.
I played this way too tight.  I should have bet.

No idea what I was thinking here. `92s` called $7.  Flop is `Aq2`. One player. Checked.
Turn is a 3. Called $11 on turn.  I suppose I had a flush draw.  River another A. Lost to 77.

`QQ` on button bet $16. 2 callers. `K68`
Bet $25. One caller. Nit player. I know he has a `K`. Check the turn. He bets the river like $40.  I fold easily.

`T9` sb. Flop is `3Q9`. Checked vs 2 players.
Called turn $10 bet when I see a `8`. I pick up a gutter but possibly other has a straight.
River is 9. I check, he bets $20. I raise all-in.  I only have like $40 more. He folds.  The reason I raised all in is because the player played just about every hand and he likes action.  I doubted he even had a `Q`.

`AJ`. Raised to $15. Against one player (same one as hand before) Flop is `4kj`. 2nd pair is not bad against a bad player. I check. Turn is 8. I check again. River is a 4. I bet $20. Got called and won.

Next hand I get `KQ` and raise to $12. I win the blinds. I'm on a roll!

At some point I do buy-in for another $100. I don't usually do that, but I wanted to play with some more chips.

I hated this hand.
`AKo` middle position.  utg+2 raised to $15.  i re-raise to $45
another player calls. original bettor raises max to $175
I fold and so does the other player.  He said he had `KQh`.  The initial player was aggressive. I assumed he had a big pair.  My guess is that he had `QQ`.  From evaluation of ranges I should have called.  I'm only a really bad dog vs `AA` and `KK`, but since I have one of those I wasn't betting he had that, but with my luck that might have been the case.

Anyways, I lose about $205 for this session.  Kind of struggled.
Table conditions were ok.
