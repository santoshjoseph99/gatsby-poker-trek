A short session at a new place.  And it was a nice poker room.  Way more tables then the Caribbean poker room.
I think I'll go over there again, but it is a little further away and with the traffic makes it nearly inaccessible on a week night.

So in this dual session I actually ended up playing some limit holdem while waiting for a NL (actually spread limit) seat.  Nothing too interesting to report at limit.  I played 4/8 and lost $24.  The game was exceptionally soft and I folded top pair with a moderate kicker which would have won.  Other then that, I would
play limit but it would have to be like 10/20 at least.

A new NL table started and most people bought in for $300, so I added $200 to the $76 from limit. There was only one hand to report (I didn't play too long, but thats another story).  I didn't bluff and didn't call with weak hands.
Funny thing about the hand that was interesting...I was just thinking in my mind about getting pocket 7's and flopping quads, so
of course I get the 7's and I was going to raise to $15, but a player to my right raises to $12 so I call.
Flop comes out `K47`, 2 diamonds. So, almost my premonition came true...*I think I have to work on those brain waves some more. LOL*.  So, 2 other players call...I'm last to act.  Everyone checks to me and I have
to bet.  I bet $30.  Player who initially raised calls.  I don't put him on a `K`, otherwise he should have
bet the flop.  I'm thinking flush draw.  Turn is a diamond.  He checks.  I check for pot control.  River comes
out a 4.  Finally get a good result.  He leads out for $45.  I think for a bit.  If he has a flush then he
will call a raise.  I have him covered...he has about $125 behind.  I do go all in and he calls.  He surprises
me.  He played `34o`.

Well, that was my big hand.  I could have played a couple more hands, but some pots got 3 and 4-bet.
I left with almost $200 profit...would have been more if not for the limit diversion.
