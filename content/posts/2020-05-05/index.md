So I kinda quit at the end of last year, when I went on my biggest downswing.  Bad decisions and bad luck.
I did end playing a little live poker before the virus took center stage.  I mainly did tournaments
and didn't do so well.
* -$70 on 1/18 @ Caribbean
* -$50 on 1/19 @ Caribbean
* -$50 on 2/1 @ Caribbean
* -$50 on 4/19 @ online (charity through work)

Also played a couple cash games...lost at NL and then for some reason I played limit and won a little bit.
The limit game was right before the shelter-in-place and of all places I won the money at the Casino Club
at Redding.  The game was 4/8 with half-kill.  I couldn't lose :)

So nothing too interesting to actually write about.  I didn't make many any terrible decisions and the format
of the tournaments (live ones) led to playing passive because I didn't get any good hands and blinds moved quickly and I had get it in when I really didn't want too.

The only interesting thing to mention was the online tournament. I played almost 130 hands and I got like 3 pairs. 66's twice and 88.  Even with that I hanged on till the last 3 tables.  I think about 165 players started.  Didn't bluff.  Most players were new so I knew I just had to play basic poker.  Might do that again.

In the mean time, I'm just building up my poker bank roll through other means and reading some poker books and playing some of the free games at Advanced Poker Training.
Also, I'm currently reading Pain Poker by Tommy Angelo.  Its actually quite good and I'll post a review of it when finished.

I hope poker will be in back in 2020!!!

PS: I couldn't find a 2020 poker image, so whatever..2018 is good enough.  Maybe I will take my own pictures in the future.
