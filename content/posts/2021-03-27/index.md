So I finally made it to the poker room in a pandemic world. Actually
I made intentions to play before this date, but the wait was hours instead of minutes and I ended up playing (winning & losing) in blackjack. This time there was a wait, and I decided to do the same thing again and find some blackjack. I did and I won enough to be happy and left the table and headed back to Graton's poker room and lo and behold I was on the list with maybe a 30 minute wait. I decided to wait it out. And I got called before my patience ran out.

It was interesting. Seven players to a table. Plexiglass around each
player. An all-in button for each player. The dealer button was a visionary hazard.
It was an obstructing hand sanitizer that looked about 90% empty.
Also, the blinds changed from 3-1 to 3-1-1...I suppose to make more action happen.

I sat in seat 5 and started out with the big blind. How fun. After
a few hands I got the lay of the land. Player in seat 7 was in every hand. Lady next to me...older asian...didn't play...so tight-passive probably. Other players seemed average. Here are the interesting hands from this session.

`KQo`
Seat 1 BB, UTG called. I raised to 15. Called by BB. UTG reraises to \$65. Seemed fishy. I folded. BB eventually called. URG had the greatest hand in NL Holdem. He won.

`KTs`
Can't remember the exact details, but I raised to 10 and the player in seat 7 called. flop `T83`. I bet. He called. Turn `Q`. Check. Check. River `A`. I decided to bet. I think \$45. Didn't have any thoughts on his range. He had such a wide range...playing all the hands. He folded. Not sure what I was trying to gain by betting at the end. Only a better hand would call.

`K8s`
I called, but S6 raised to \$25. S7 called. I folded. I would have had 2 pair on the flop.

`99`
S2 raises \$22. I call. I guess I was set mining. 2 overcards on the flop and a bet. I folded.

`93s`
Small blind. I should have called. I would have ended up with a full house.

To summarize...
I lost `$100`, and I enjoyed the time. It was an interesting experience. I didn't play as aggressive as I could. And I didn't gamble as well. I probably played a couple of hours. I would definitely try it again.
