Drank some coffee about 7pm.  Headed to the casino about 830pm.  Started the evening playing $10 Blackjack.
Hanged around the blackjack table till I almost made my money back.  The dealer was new...needed help many
times.  The play was slow.  My strategy/system which I practice at home didn't really work, but it shouldn't
work all the time.  I left the table $25 down.  The only interesting thing to mention was that my last hand.
I basically went all in...couldn't remember the count. Thankfully the blackjack gods sent a small favor my way
and I got dealt blackjack.  I was doubling the previous few bets ($20->$40->$80), so it like a $80 bet.

After that almost disastrous adventure playing blackjack.  I headed to the poker room.  It was busy but I got
a seat right away at my usual 1/3 NL.  I bought in for $200.  I will describe a few hands.  I think I played them ALL wrong.  One thing to mention was the player to my right.  I could see his hole cards as he looked...I couldn't see it
all the time, but I think I got about 50% of his cards.  Ethically I assume this is wrong, but should I tell him?
I didn't it.  I should have taken advantage of this fact (see Wrong Hand 2)

### Wrong Hand 1
I was dealt AKo at the BB. It was raised to $10 from UTG+3. Button called.  I raised to $30. Both players called.
I'm already uncomfortable.  If no A or K on the flop I'm checking.  Flop comes out Q64.  Everyone checks.
Turn comes out 8.  I decide to bet $35.  UTG+3 thinks for a bit and raises to $80.  I guess he knew I was weak. He won the pot.  I should have checked again and folded to a bet.  It was a dry flop.  I should have c-bet for $30 and
called it a day if called or raised.  Simple as that.

### Wrong Hand 2
Dealt 77 in middle position. Straddle pot, so $6 to go.  I have about $75.  I usually don't reload, so I'm short stacked and waiting to get it in with a good hand.  UTG+2 raised to $10 and player to right calls.  He has TT.
Flop comes out K37.  Club flush draw and I'm holding a club.  First players bets $10, 2nd player calls.
What should I do?  I got the best hand.  Should I be scared of the flush draw?  How about the player with pocket tens?
Neither of those should bother me.  I should just call. But I don't.  I jam.  I was hoping the first player had
the K and would call.  Neither players call.  I pick up a small pot.  I should have called and either bet or raised on the turn.
I left money on the table.

### Wrong Hand 3
New player seats down UTG+1 and calls.  3 other players call.  I'm in the BB and I'm dealt A9h.  I check.
Flop looks pretty good. 494.  I check. UTG+1 player bets $11. Everyone folds. I call.  I check the turn
which is a 6.  He bets $11 and I call.  River comes a K. I check and he bets $30.  So he isn't scared of the K.
I'm thinking he could have a 4 or a weaker 9.  Like KQJ kicker.  I'm completely wrong as I call the the bet.
He has KK.  I should have clearly folded the river.

### Wrong Hand 4
I'm on the button. I pick up AQ of diamonds.  Hijack raises to $23.  I call. Heads up on the fold.
Qh xd x (x means small cards).  He c-bets $25. I call.  Turn is a diamond (another small card). He checks.  So what does he have?  If he AA or KK or stronger
he would continue the betting.  Anything weaker could be checking.  From what I see, he isn't an overly aggressive
player.  So what should I do?  If I bet most likely I'm getting called by a better hand.  With the turn card, it
gives me 9 more outs to the nut flush.  I should have checked, instead I jam.  He folds showing 99.  I think a
check and a bet on the river or a raise would have been the better play.  More money left on table?

### Summary
I did walk away with $245. Not sure how I did that, with those mistake hands.  Well, I suppose I did win a couple
of those mistake hands:).  Also I did get a straight on another hand...won about $75 and another hand I did get a
flush on the river, but didn't win anything.
I felt I do a couple of aggressive things, which at times I lack, but I'm not paying enough attention to my
opponent's ranges.  I need to spend more time doing that.
