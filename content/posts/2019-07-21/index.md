Well, finally playing poker on a regular basis in Washington.  I'm not a huge fan of the small card room.  I enjoy the casino
atmosphere.  There just seems to be more action or maybe I can get lost in the crowd more easily.  This place, the Caribbean
Cardroom in Kirkland reminds me of the Casino Club in Redding CA.  Its small, basically consisting of 7 tables of cash and I think
about 3 tables of tournament.  Most of the people seem to know each other.  Im pretty sure I won't get to know anyone.  Its not
my style.  An introvert trying to be sociable is like watching someone who has never driven in snow....its an embrassing accident
waiting to happen.  Anyways, this post will be the result of two outing.  I'll cut to the chase. I lost both times, but I'm not
unhappy.  Both games are 1-3 NL holdem.  I think its spread limit 3-300.  Doesn't matter to me...my starting stack is my usual $200.

Session on 7-21
I didn't get too many hands.  Acutually got a few pairs but didn't strike gold.  
Early on got `AK`o from UTG.  I raised to 5x BB.  Everyone folded. Nice. I called with `44` twice and `77` to raises and had to fold
after the flop because of missing out on the set.  
`AQ`o on the button. Raised to 18 (I think).  2 callers (both limp called before me).  Flop comes out `KJ7`.  Checked to me.  I make the
c-bet of $25.  One player folds...2nd player makes it interesting.  Raises to like $75.  I fold.  My inside straight draw is not betting
a K.
`87s` called a raise of $10. Flop is `KT8`.  Great I have bottom pair, but luckily it gets checked around.  5 players.  Turn is nice.
Its a `7`, but also completes a straight and now a flush draw is out there.  Player to my right bets $15.  I had about $100.  So I go
all in.  It works...he thinks for a little bit, but folds.
`AJ`o UTG.  I call (first mistake).  I should have done the usual raise to at least $12 or $15.  Anyways, a few players are in.
Flop comes.  `A82`.  BB bets $15 I call.  A couple other people call.  Turn is a `2`.  BB goes for pot contorl and bets $10.  I call.
The SB or button...can't remember...older guy with an hearing aid.  He raises to $100.  We all fold.  I believe him.  He might have
had a 2 or `A8`.  The BB said he had a `A` as well.  My kicker was better then his.  I left...I was down $62.

Session on 7-27
Really card dead.  Same table and seat as the previous session.  I changed seats from seat 9 to seat 4.  It pays off quickly.
I flop a straight and win a decent pot...putting me back or around to my initial buyin.  There is a really bad player in seat 2
who is getting lucky and making silly calls.  Anyways, he calls a raise for $10 and I find `KK`.  I raise to $30.  He calls.
Heads up.  Flop is `834` with 2 hearts. I got an heart.  I bet $40, he easily calls.  Turn is another heart.  He puts me all in.
Not sure why he did that.  I think for a little bit.  I don't think I'm beat.  I call.  I'm right, but he is on a massive draw.
Flush draw and gutter and overcard.  A heart comes on the river...unfortunately he has the `A of hearts`.  He was behind the entire
way till the river.  I'm glad he called.  

So I need to get back in the grove.  I'm not practicing tournament poker on the advanced poker training website.  I should though.
Caribbean has a few tournaments.  They are just really bad structures.  I might need to find a casino, but most things are kind of far.
I kind of miss my old situation.  I was getting better at Graton.  I gave up my chance for the world series of poker because of the new
job...wish I didn't.  You only live once.
