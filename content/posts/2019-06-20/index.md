Long story short, but I made it to a final table.  It wasn't easy and I even made a significant mistake along the way, but a little luck sure was nice.

I started the tournament late.  I was busy losing money at the blackjack tables.  After losing enough I headed over to the poker room.  I was a little late to the game and I had to get on a wait list.  I saw 3 tables going and finally enough people signed up and we had a full 4th table.  I got a lot of hands to review!

I got off to a really good start...

`25s` in the `BB`.  I pair my 5 and get a flush draw. Flop was like `A5J`.  Four other players.  Button bets. I call.  Everyone else folds.  Can't remember the exact details, but I get a `2` on the turn and call another bet. I check the river. Button checks.  I should have bet value on the river.  I didn't want to raised. Bottom 2 pair is a easy hand to get beat with, so I checked for `pot control`.

Maybe its the next hand, but I get `77` in the SB.  I think 3 or 4 in the hand.  Flop comes out `3h2h7s`.  I check.  Button bets big. I raise all-in.  He thinks for a little bit and calls. He has an over pair. I think `88`.  I win and kind of double up.

`QQ` on the button.  I think the blinds are 2/4.  I raise to 1500.  Four players including the blinds call.  Flop comes out `T88`.  Checks to me. I bet. One caller.  Turn is a `8`.  Check to me.  I bet all-in.  He calls. He turns over `66`.  Win another big pot.

`QQ` again on the button.  I raise.  `BB` calls. Flop comes out `Axx`.  I bet. He calls. Turns comes out another `A`, decreasing his chances of having an `A`, so I bet again. I'm hoping he has `JJ` or `TT`, but he calls. He checks river.  Pot is pretty big. Probably like 20k.  Not sure what I can bet here to get him of the hand. `A` with a good kicker isn't going to fold. I check. He has `A9`.  If I went all-in I don't think he would have called.

After losing that hand and second guessing my last action, I tilted a little bit...
I limped in with `A5` and the next player went all-in. I estimated his range to included all pairs and `Ax` and face cards (I played several cash games with him, and I know him to be a little lose).  It wasn't too much more and I called.  He had `AQ` and won.  Lost about 4k.

My big stack was down. Started the tournament with 10k and now was at 22k at the break.

Picked up `98s` in the `BB`. Unraised, so I just checked.  Picked up a straight flush draw vs 2 players (`6s7s3d`). I checked and button bet and I called.  Turn is a `J`.  Didn't complete my straight or flush.
`SB` checked.  I go all in. I feel like playing a little lose and too aggressive.  Button thinks for a bit and folds.  Claims she had a flush draw as well.

Another orbit...picked up `58s` in the `BB`.  Seems like a trend.  I'm getting interesting cards in the big blind and forced to play.
I get a 4 card straight on the river and `SB` bets 5k.  I go all in and win.  A couple people had the lower straight and correctly folded.
I think my chip count is about `38k` now.

This is where my mistake went down.  I pick up `JJ` on the SB.  UTG+2 is a new player who goes all in for about 11k or so.  Next player calls.  Folded to me.  I call.  This is the mistake. I should have went all in.  BB has less and goes all in and another player who had limped, calls as well.
Too many players.  Flop comes `Q35`.  Its checked over to the player who first called the all-in. He goes all-in and I fold.  He shows `66`.  The BB who went all in had `AQ` and wins.
I should have won the side pot.

Break.

Down to 2 tables.

My chip count is down and the blinds being high, I go all in blind. I win with `T3`.

I somehow have 30k.

I go all-in with `A9` and win the blinds, bringing me to about 40k.

Finally its the final table.  Pay outs start at 6th place.  We have 8 players.  2 players have less then me.
Blinds are 4k/2k with 400 big blind ante (I think).

`J9s` on the button all-in. Blinds fold
I have approx 40k.

Blinds go up.  One player get knocked off and its break time again.

We decide to pay out the bubble player with $20 each.  I guess its ok.  I would would make $10 profit then.  Lucky the blinds will reach the player with less chips then me.  And she goes out.

I'm guaranteed 6th place.  I'm UTG and go all in with `64o`.  I'm not sure I looked.  One player calls and so does the `BB`.  Flop can't get too much better for me.  I flop 2 pair with a Q.  `BB` bets out.  I'm sure he has a Q.  Other player folds and I'm ahead.  Turn and river are disastrous.  Its another Q and then an A.  Giving the villain a full house.

I'm out.  Happy I made it far.  I think aggressive play my be the only way to win the tournament.  I went all-in several times and won all of them except for one.  Its hard to play perfect.  Not going all in with `JJ` and not value betting my `25` turned out to be mistakes.
