Just like the image that is shown on this post...I couldn't do it.
I couldn't lay down an hand and it cost me the tournament. I made it made further along then in a long time, but couldn't make the one
decision that counted. Lets get into some hands before we get into the infamous one.

Just another Sunday morning bounty tournament at Graton.  It cost $150 for 10K chips and you get $25 for each person you knock out.  I got one bounty chip.

`AQo` on the cutoff. Blinds are probably 200/400. Player before me calls. I raise to $1500. BB calls.  Player before me calls.
Flop comes out very favorable.  `AQx`.  And like finding some money in the street, the BB goes all-in.  Player before folds.
I can't fold top two. I don't think that should ever be a fold.
I call and basically double up.

Some time later...`33` late position.  UTG raises to 800. 2 callers.  I call.  SB raises to 3300K.  3 players call.  I fold.
Hmmmm...I'm thinking I got `priced in`?  Its only 2500K to close the action.  There is 13200 in the pot.  Should have called.  I would have had a set on the flop.  SB bets and everyone folds.

Some time earlier...`86d` called in late position. 4 players. Flop misses everyone..so everyone checks.  Turns comes out another diamond, so I bet.  2 callers.  River is a dud.  Checked to me and I bet.  I win.  Only reason I bet is that there weren't any straights or flushes.

`QQ` on the button.  Folded to me.  Raised to 2K.  SB calls.
All small cards on flop. SB donk bets 3k.  I think a little bit.
Should I call and then possibly see a K or A on the turn or raise?  I had about 17K starting.  I went all in.  SB folded.
I thought this was the only reasonable thing to do.  I didn't have enough to raise and then make an impact full bet on the T or R.  Calling wasn't good...8 over cards out there.
Approx 23k after this hand. Not bad.

Later on...`99`.  I called in from middle position.  7 players see the flop. `AQQ` on the flop.  Checked twice.  I feel I
should have raised, but with that flop that would have frozen me.  Those cards would have hit opponents hands if they called a raise.  Anyways, button bet and got the pot.

20K at break.  Not feeling so great.  I missed a good opportunity with `33`.

After a few unmentionable hands...table got broken up, which is a good sign.  People dropping out :)  Low on chips in the new table.  I'm waiting for good hands to go all in.  I get `T8o` from middle position...less then 20k chips and blinds are at 400/800 with big blind ante of 800.  I got all in.  No calls.

A few hands later I got all in with `J8o`.  I get a caller.  Not feeling so good.  He has `22`.  I win with a `J` on the river.  I'm probably around 30k chips.

I get `AQo` from UTG+1.  Go all in. No callers. Next hand I get `88` from UTG.  Get called by `A4s`.  I win.  Doubling up to 63k.  I'm feeling good.

A few hands later.  I get `JJ` on the button.  Blinds are at 1k/2k with 2k big blind ante.  I raise to 8k.  SB goes all in for less and BB calls (this is the BB I bet with `J8`).  Flop comes out 66T.  He checks. I bet like 10K.  He calls. Turn comes another T.  He bets like 15k.  This gets me thinking.  He looks like a beginner and is playing straightforward. I should have folded. I feel like he has a `T`.  Anyways, I call.  River is another `6`.  Giving me a full house.  Yeah, but his `T` still beats me.  He goes all in. I don't spend enough time thinking about this. I feel like I'm pot committed. I call.  He has quads tens.  I should have folded the turn.  Oh well.  If it was a tricky, aggressive player it would have been OK to call or go all in on the turn.  But this person was basically telegraphing his plays and I didn't realize that until too late.  Maybe I did in the back of my mind, but I didn't call time and think about the situation more.
