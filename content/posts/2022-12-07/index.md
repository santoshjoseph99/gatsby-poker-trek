### Intro

This is a little late of a post, but I made it to Vegas. The purpose was to hang out with friends and play
some golf, but there was time for poker. Almost every night. One night wasn't very good. It was late. I
had just lost \$300 in Blackjack. I was tired. I still played and totally shouldn't have. I shouldn't have
played BJ either. Lessons learned I suppose. That happened in the Venetian. Not my favorite poker room. I
have to stop playing there, but it probably doesn't matter. I actually played there a couple nights later
and won a few bucks. So it wasn't that bad, but it still sucked. The bright spot was Caesars Palace.

### The Tournament at Caesars Place

I was relaxed. _Very relaxed._ We had a good dinner and the evening was free. The 9pm tournament was at a perfect time. Entry fee was \$150 and I think about 30 people signed up. So not a big tournament, but it was enough to last four hours. I really can't
imagine how people play for 8+ in a tournament. Its so hard to focus for that long at least for myself. I have to say. I got some _rungood_. And I was happy to get the
cards and push people all in. Players needed draws to hit and they missed over and
over again. A memorable hand, was at the final table. Yours truly was the chip leader.

In early position. Player to my right raises. I look down and see a decent hand but this hand is the one that kicks you hard in the stomach. `JJ`: Its a love or hate with
that hand (with everyone I think). Its tricky to play. I thought about calling, but I didn't want anybody
else getting decent pot odds so I raise. I can't remember the exact numbers, but I think the player raised to 3x BB and I doubled his bet at least. Everyone folds back
to him and then he goes all in. If I lose I wouldn't be chip leader and I take a big
hit to my stack and my ego. I think about it for a while. I really think his range his
high. I don't know his play, but its early in the final table and he goes all in vs
the chip leader. I put in on QQ-AA and AK. I'm ok vs AK but i'm a big dog against
the others. I lay down after going in the tank a little bit. I felt it was the right
decision. I put a lot of factors in that hand including my stack.

Other then that I made a bluff when it got down 3 handed on a missed draw but the other
player checked and I couldn't win without taking a shot. It would have put me 2nd place if he called. I think he had an A. I won that. And then took him out later.

Too bad it wasn't a bounty tournament. I knocked out a lot of players. Maybe 7?

My buddy was playing as well and he was short stacked for some time but he managed
to survive a few all ins and he finished 2nd.

### Summary

So it was a most enjoyable tournament. It felt like I couldn't do anything wrong. I
did lose like 3 hands, but I folded a couple of times where I would have lost considerable chips if I had lost. I was focused. Very focused and relaxed. Whatever
I did to prepare for that tournament is exactly what I need to do every time.  
Buy-in: `$150`, Profit: `$1350`. Not bad for four hours work.
