Sometimes a mobile ATM walks into the poker room and conveniently sits down at the same table as yours truly and begins spewing money
uncontrollably.  Doesn't happen very often but its good (at least for most people on the table).  I took advantage of that.
Here are the most memorable hands of one of my better cash games.

The Caribbean cardroom was busy, actually full.  All seven of the cash game tables were occupied and unfortuntately multiple games of 3-6
limit holdem was being played.  I still have no idea why people play 3-6.  Its a horribly boring game.  Even 4-8 is boring if there isn't a kill
pot.  Anyways, they started a new no-limit table just for me on the tournament side of the poker room, which had three tables.
So I started the table without any reads of the players.  Most people bought in for $200 to $300.  Players sits next to me and buys
in for $500, which may be the max.  I bought in for my customary $200.  I have to increase that at some point.  Soon.

1st hand UTG I get `55`.  I call.  Player next to me raises to $20. So at this point I don't know anything about this player.  Player
on the button also calls.  Flop is `K26`.  I check.  Mr aggressive bets like $40.  Button folds.  I fold.  He shows `87`.  I'm getting a
hint about him.

A short time later...well maybe a couple orbits, I look down at the 2nd best poker hand, `KK`.  I raise to $21.  Mr agressive raises
to $135.  Nice.  It gets folded back to me.  I go all in.  Its only like $37 more.  He calls. I hit trips on the flop.
And he does a `5` when folding.  I double up.

`ATo`.  I call the $10 raise. 4 players to the flop.  Mr agressive is in the hand as well.  At this point, he lost $500 and bought in for
another $300. (He eventually buys in for another $500 and then $500 more).
Flop `QT8`. 2nd pair and no one is interested in the pot. Checked around.
Turn `9`. Four to a straight and I'm not betting.  No one does either.  
River `A`.  Gives me 2 pair. I can't help myself.  I bet $20.  Guess what, Mr Agressive raises!  But to only $40. Other 2 players
fold.  I make the call.  He should have raised to $100 or so. I would have folded.
I win.  He had 2 pair as well `QT`.

`T9h` in early position. A 9 was exposed.  I should have folded, but I called $15.  Folded on flop.

Mr agressive makes a seat change. Goes to seat 1 (I'm in seat 4).  He makes a max straddle at $30.  I pick up `JJ`.  I raise to $100.
Usually I despise `JJ`.  So many hands can beat `JJ`.
Player in seat 7, goes all in...but I think its for like $75.  Gets folded to Mr agressive and he goes all in.  I call.
Flop: `Qxx`
Turn: `Q`
River: `J`
Mr agressive show something like `A6`.  Other player shows `77`.  I win a nice pot.  Guess I don't mind `JJ` after all.

`43o` in middle position.  I limp in.  Its just me and Mr agressive.
Flop: `32A`, we both check.
Turn: `3`, we both check again.
River: `5`.  He bets $35.  I raise to $100.  He calls.
I don't know about this play.  He could easily beat me with `46`.  Or he could have the same hand.

This is a bad hand I played.  I started playing a little loose.  I get `74h` and I raise to $15 in middle position.
Player to my left called. Older, quiet guy.  Flop is `A85` with 2 hearts. I kind of like it.  I c-bet $20.
He raises to $60.  I call.  I have some draws.  Turn is `A`.  I check. He bets $75.  Either he has an `A` or maybe
a boat.  I fold even though I still have some draws.  Post analysis which I didn't do at the table...
There is $120+$75, so lets say $200 and its $75 to call.
Its 1 to 2.6 to call. I have an flush draw and an gutter.  13 outs.  From https://www.thetapoker.com/outs.html, it looks
like I have 1 to 2.5 to call.  I should have called.

`AQ` in BB.  UTG raises to $15.  Button calls. I call.
3 plaers.  Flop `AQJ`.  Instantly a hand like `KT` is in play.  I check.
Initial bettor c-bets $20. We both call.
I think thats a mistake right there.  I need to know my place in this hand.  If I want this pot and I'm out of position, I
should raise here.  I think a raise to $100 wins this pot or I possibly lose to a straight, but I have a redraw.
Turn is `T`.  So I easily check.  Other 2 players check.  River is a blank (2).  I check.  Initial bettor bets $100.
Button take a minute and calls. I fold quickly.
Winner is button who shows `A2`.

I leave a few minutes later. Mr agressive left the table a few minutes ago.

Total profit is $516.

So if I look back at these hands. I notice a pattern. I win against a bad player but when put into other situations which I need
to evaluate and think a little more, I didn't do the right actions.  I need to take my time and think things through a little bit more.
