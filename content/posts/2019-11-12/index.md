The art of the check raise?  Should it be done all the time?  Should I mix it up?  No, unless I'm playing
against the same people all the time, then you should use it and use it big time.  Here are 3 mistakes
from playing at Graton, Caribbean and Fortune poker rooms.  I lost about $800 total on these 3 hands (which is quite a bit for me at least!).
So if you flop a strong hand and you are out of position and against multiple people and with a resonably 
wet board, what should you do?  Of course it depends.
So I'll explain what I did and what I should have done...

*** Hand #1: Misery at Graton ***
`ATc` UTG.  I just call (mistake #1?).  about 4 people call. Button raises to $15. I call, so does 3 players
including a player who posted a missed blinds.  
Flop `AT4`.  I was texting and then I decided to attack the pot. I normally would have checked.  1 caller. I bet like $30 or $40.
Turn `5`.  I check. I put my only opponent (the player who had posted the missed blind), on 2 pair or set. He checks.
River blank.  I check again. He bets like $50. I instacall.  He show `23`.
What I should have done:
pre-flop: raise to $15 or call $15 from button
flop: check.  then CHECK-RAISE.  To about $75 to $100.
That should have done the trick.

*** Hand #2: Surprise at Caribbean ***
in SB with `44`.  Pot is raised to $12.  4 callers.  
Flop: `K45` 2 diamonds.  I check.  Late position player bets $25. I call so does BB.
Turn: `6`.  Check, Check.  He goes all in for about $80.  I raise all in.  BB folds recluently.
River: `8`.  He shows a straight on the river.
What I should have done:
pre-flop: call is fine.
flop: check. then CHECK-RAISE to $100 to $125.
turn: if called.  Go all in...would have like $200 left.
That could have worked.  I could have nicely represented the `K`.

*** Hand #3: Aggression at Fortune ***
in SB with `99`.  Post is raised to $12. 3 players.
Flop: `QT9` rainbow.  I check. Middle player bet $15.  Next player raises to $30.
I have like $500...just won a good pot...after many hands of boredom and had asked for a table change.
I raise to $200.  It seems the middle player is tanking, but he had thought the player before him had
cards...when he relazies its his turn, he quickly calls the $200.  I think he has a straight `J8`. Other player
folds.
Turn: `6`.  I think for a bit.  Maybe he has 2 pair or a straight draw.  I go all in for around $280. He calls.
River: `2`.  I lose.
What I should have done:
pre-flop: call is fine
flop: check, then raise to $100.  If the player quickly calls, then I should get it that he has me beat (usually).
turn: check, call.
river: check fold.

Anyways, seems like a common theme...early position with a strong hand and not being able to correctly make the 
right action.  The third had was the toughest, but it should have been the easiest.  I could have easily been beat
with a higher set or straight draw.

So I'm a big losing streak.  Might have to slow down a little bit and think things through a little bit more.  Games
are so much tougher then a few years ago and I'm not getting any luck.  Variance is a `bitch`.
