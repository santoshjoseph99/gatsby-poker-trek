First time this happened.  I sit down in and I think I'm in the big blind.  I get dealt `AA`.
Someone raises to $25 from middle position. A player I know and I get the feeling he will call
a raise.  So I do.  I raise to $65.  He thinks for a bit and raises all-in.  I call. He has
slightly more then me.  I double up. So I have exactly $600. Long story short.  About 4 hours later
I walk about with $603.  I suck.  Glad I won, but I should have won more.  I got `AA` twice more
and lost both of those hands.  I got `TT` 3 times and won those hands.  But struggled to really
get on a winning streak.

Another session.  Played my first bomb pots.  Won one of them:) I lost $300 in this session.  Quite annoying, but I 
lost 3 times to a player who each time I was a favorite pre-flop & flop. I need players like this
for poker to be fun, but I hate losing those hands.

Another session.  Down $600.  Really didn't have anything going.  Just made a few bad calls.
Actually had a royal flush draw. If the `A` of `spades` would hit, then I would have won $10K.
Of course that didn't happen.  

I think my theme is this...I lose too much in hands (I call too many times especially when I there is like
a 10% chance of winning) and I don't win enough (my bet sizing is wrong).

Anyways, my bankroll is down and out.  I'm taking a hiatus.  And not going to "study" poker.  I'm tired of the
variance and losing.  Maybe I'll reboot with tournament poker.  Maybe not.  I'm not enjoying the game it seems.
Maybe limit poker?  The decisions are easier.  Can't lose that much. Lol.
