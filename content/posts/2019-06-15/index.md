`QJo` in the `BB`
UTG+2 raises to 15 (5x BB).  Typical raise for this game.  Button and SB call. I call as well.
Flop comes out `QT6`.  Everyone checks.  Turn comes at a `8`.  I bet $25.  One caller
who is the small blind.  River completes a straight.  `SB` bets $50.  I think for a little
and call.  I had the other `J` in my hand so that reduced chances for that straight, but he
probably wouldn't call 25 for that straight.  He could have had a `K` kicker or better perhaps.
2 pair hands and sets would call my $25 bet, but he could have had a `J` kicker as well.
I won...he had pair of 3's.

`AQd` in `BB`
Button raises to $12.  I call.  Possibly I could raise, but I'm sure he would call and I'm out of position for the whole hand.
Flop comes out `QJx`.  I got top pair, top kicker and I'm not going anywhere fast.  Check, bet, & call for flop and turn with bets
of $25 and $50.  Check, check river.  He mucks.  I like that hand.
He seemed like a good player.  Had me covered easy.  I don't know what I would do if HE bet big on the river.  I can't remember what those 2 cards where, but they did not help a straight or flush to complete.

`AJc` in middle position.
I raise to $15. One caller. Flop is low cards and turn is low too.
I bet out twice.  $25 and $45.  I win.

`AKh` in button.
A couple of limpers.  I raise to $16.  Everyone calls.  So we have total 5 players on the flop. I get a K, but there is a flush draw and a J.  Checked to me and I bet $45.  Everyone folds. I get lucky I think.  I tell people that my `bullets` held up.  I feel I could have showed my hand.

I had a couple of other interesting hands, but no money gained.  A full house on the river, but no callers.  I flop a straight, but another player is open ended and I have to split a small pot.

All in all, I think I played well. I betted out and made a couple of good calls and I tried to think about the other player ranges.
I didn't rush anything, but at the end when I decided to leave, I played passively.  I didn't want to lose my profits.  The session turned out to be only 2 hours, but I play BJ before and I was getting tired.

Note:  I won $35 playing BJ. Counted but lost the count multiple times.  I actually lost $100 and made that back and then some, so it was pretty good.
