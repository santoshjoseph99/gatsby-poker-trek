Well, this ended up being a short session.  I felt the poker gods were against me, but there are no gods that I can tell off (Ok, so that is another post).  I just got unlucky, but I wasn't unhappy.  A casino makes money by always being on the positive side of the bet.  As a poker player we can't control that.  And it hurts a little bit when you lose hands when you are like having a 90% chance of winning.

Quite possibly I should have stayed and bought in again, since I was getting goods hands and the table had players that weren't very good.  I have a rule, that if I lose my buy-in then I leave.  I probably should
expand on that rule.

I think my first hand was `99`.  Called in middle position. Missed flop and folded to a bet.  Lots of big cards on the flop.

I get `44` soon thereafter.  I call. A few players on the flop.
I flop a full house. `T4T`.  I check so I can trap.  No flush draws or straight draws.  Only a `T` would call or another small pair.  Turn is a `8`.  Player to my right bets 15. I call and the player to my left calls (both women).  River is an `T`.  Now the player who bet the turn is beating me or the player to my left.  This is probably the worst card I could have received.  Player to my right checks. I bet $20. Player to my left raises.  And so I mention bad players on the table and I mentioned 2 women and they both are sitting next to me.  I would presume a good player would have raised more.  She doubled my raise.  Was she being nice or just wanted a few more bucks.  Player to my right folds...I guess she didn't have an `8`.  So either the player to my left has the `8` or a `T`.  I'm not folding but not raising either.  I would have definitely called more.  She has an `T9`.  I had a 85% to win that hand from the flop.  Oh well.

Next hand...I get `44` again. But I miss the flop and soon fold.

A few hands later I get `33` in middle position. Flop is `522`. I Bet $20 for my gutter and pair. I win. It was a straddle pot vs. 4 players.

`QT of diamonds` in BB.  Early position player raises to $12.  I like playing this hand for a few reasons. Its suited and closely connected, but it can get easily dominated, so you have to play it carefully. I call.  Flop is a dream.  `JTT`.  So now I have the `T` and I can try for quads.  Initial better bets $35. Only has like $75 behind. Folded to me. Easy play. I raise all in.  We have about the same amount.  I turn my cards over.  Turn is a blank and river is the only card that can scare me. Its a `J`.  Guess what, he had `J9s`.  And wins.  That is another hand that I'm in the lead after the flop big time (90%).  Would it have been different if I bet out?  How about if we both had deeper stacks?  Would he call my check raise then?

Anyways, it was good playing at Graton again.  I miss the place.
