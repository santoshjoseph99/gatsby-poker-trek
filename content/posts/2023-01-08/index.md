### Intro

So I'm reaching the end of the line for poker. At least _Cash Games_ I think.
I have simply lost interest in cash games. I've been on a downswing in cash, and I have played better in tournaments.
Also I feel like in cash games it gets a little boring and you really have to be good at post flop play. Tournaments
get down to some well placed all-ins and its more skill pre-flop and less decisions.

### Graton Casino

I sat down for about an hour. It was really boring. I didn't get any good cards and I called too much and therefore I lost.
It wasn't fun. I walked away with about `$75` after my typical buyin of `$300`. Went to the blackjack tables and lost that and
then some, but I enjoyed that time more then poker. I do think besides the annoying downswing I'm seeing in cash, I'm lacking some aggressiveness and also a lack of understanding of post flop play. My main problem is that I call too much on the river. I seem to bleed on
the river and don't know how to fix that. Of course there are a few more leaks:

- playing too many hands
- not C-betting
- not calling C-bets
- not 3-betting
- slowplaying too much
- calling too much
- and whatever else!

### Summary

I've decided to stop playing cash games and stick with tournaments. When I say tournaments, not
the big, glamorous, WSOP-type but maybe like `50`-`75` people or so. I could have success. My local
casino has a weekly Thursday night for `$165` (bounty for `$25`). I've played it twice recently
and haven't knocked anyone off. Next post I'll add some hands from those 2 games which I've
lost.
